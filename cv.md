        let counter25=0,  counter50=0;
        for (let i =0; i<peopleInLine.length;i++)
        if (peopleInLine[i]===100&&(counter25>0&&(counter50>0||counter25>2)))
        counter50>0?(counter50--,counter25--):counter25-=3;
        } else if (peopleInLine[i]===50&&counter25>0) {
            counter50++;
            counter25--;
        } else if (peopleInLine[i]===25) {
            counter25++;
        } else return "NO";
        }
        return "YES";
        }
